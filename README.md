 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
This project showcases the end-to-end process of building a modern data warehouse and generating useful insights using SQL. It’s designed as a hands-on learning and portfolio project that reflects real-world data engineering and analytics practices.

 Data Architecture: Medallion Model
The project follows the Medallion Architecture approach, which organizes data into three layers:

Bronze Layer: Raw data directly loaded from source CSV files into SQL Server without any transformation.

Silver Layer: Data is cleaned, formatted, and normalized to prepare it for analysis.

Gold Layer: Final layer with business-ready data structured into a star schema for reporting and dashboards.

 Project Highlights
 
Here’s what this project includes:

Data Modeling: Designing and creating fact and dimension tables for analytics.

ETL Pipelines: Loading data from source to warehouse using SQL scripts and stored procedures.

Analytics: Writing SQL queries for reports and insights using the Gold layer data.

End-to-End Flow: From raw data ingestion to clean, query-ready datasets.
